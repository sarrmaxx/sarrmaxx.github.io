<p> Everybody uses products made out of plastic. Whether its starbucks cups or ziplocks or plastic bags or straws.
Once you disgard these items do you know where it goes? Well... some of it goes to the recycling places but
majority of it gets thrown into the oceans. This is a very dangerous thing for the animals that call the ocean
home. For example, turtles eat jellyfish, and you know what looks like jellyfish in the water? Plastic bags.
So instead of eating a jellyfish they eat the plastic bag which chokes them and they die. But the plastic doesnt
only affect them, it affects us too. If the fish we eat consume some of the plastic products we consume them too.
How can we prevent this from happening? Well, you can limit the amount of plastic you use. </p>

    <h4><strong> 1) Use reusable straws:</strong> </h4>
      <p>
      Whenever you get a drink from the restaurant or drink store
      most of the time you will use a plastic straw. But, instead of using a plastic straw that you use once and then
      throw it away you should get a straw you can use for a long time.
    </p>
    <h4> <strong> 2) Use reusable bags instead of plastic ones:</strong> </h4>
    <p>
       When you go grocery shopping instead of getting plastic bags get a reusable bag that you can use for every trip
        you go to. Also you end up saving money because now you have to pay to get a plastic or paper bag at any grocery
        store you go to.
    </p>
    <h4> <strong> 3) Use reusable containers/ waterbottles</strong> </h4>
    <p>
       Instead of using plastic water bottles or disposable container get containers/ waterbottles that you can use for
        a long time and reducing your waste.
    </p>
